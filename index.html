# Welcome! 
You can find my ~not so~ impressive collection of (no|low)code tests here. I encourage you to explore and discover my work on Github's repo.

I aim to use "prompts" in my classes to increase student engagement and participation during my lectures. Additionally, I'm also using it to build the lecture as well :)
